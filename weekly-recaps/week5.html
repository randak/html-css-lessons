        <p>
            This week, we continued our work on recreating the <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ouija_2014">
            Ouija</a> page on Rotten Tomatoes. While we focused primarily on HTML last week, this week we introduced
            some more CSS to start making the page look more true to its original. We also discussed how to create an
            HTML table.
        </p>
        <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
        <section>
            <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
            <p>
                Tables in HTML have a long history of abuse as a layout element. This is not the intent of the
                <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag; rather, it is intended to present tabular data. Looking again at
                <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ouija_2014">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, we can see that the content
                in the aside is tabular data&mdash;there are three tables of movies, each listed with a rating, title, and
                release date. Let's look at the basic code for creating a table.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
                The primary tag for a table is, as you might guess, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. The contents of a table
                are a bit less obvious. A table in HTML is composed of rows and cells. Rows are represented with
                <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, while cells are represented with <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, except for header cells,
                which are represented with <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>. Here is how the aforementioned movies table would be
                represented in code.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;movieListing&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-rating&quot;&gt;48%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-title&quot;&gt;Saw&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-date&quot;&gt;Oct 31&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;movieListing&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-rating&quot;&gt;85%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-title&quot;&gt;John Wick&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-date&quot;&gt;Oct 24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;movieListing&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-rating&quot;&gt;41%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-title&quot;&gt;23 Blast&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-date&quot;&gt;Oct 24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;movieListing&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-rating&quot;&gt;67%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-title&quot;&gt;Laggies&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-date&quot;&gt;Oct 24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;movieListing&quot;&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-rating&quot;&gt;53%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-title&quot;&gt;White Bird in a Blizzard&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;movieListing-date&quot;&gt;Oct 24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>And here's what it looks like as HTML:</p>
            <table>
                <tr class="movieListing">
                    <td class="movieListing-rating">48%</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-title">Saw</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-date">Oct 31</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="movieListing">
                    <td class="movieListing-rating">85%</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-title">John Wick</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-date">Oct 24</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="movieListing">
                    <td class="movieListing-rating">41%</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-title">23 Blast</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-date">Oct 24</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="movieListing">
                    <td class="movieListing-rating">67%</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-title">Laggies</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-date">Oct 24</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="movieListing">
                    <td class="movieListing-rating">53%</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-title">White Bird in a Blizzard</td>
                    <td class="movieListing-date">Oct 24</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Tables can be used in more complex ways as well. <code>rowspan</code> and <code>colspan</code> allow
                you to define a table cell that takes up more than it's space, pushing the other cells out of the way.
                Here's an example:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td style="background-color: aliceblue;" rowspan="2">This cell has <code>rowspan="2"</code></td>
                    <td style="background-color: darkblue; color: white;" colspan="2">This cell has <code>colspan="2"</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="background-color: lavender;">These cells have no</td>
                    <td style="background-color: lavender;"><code>rowspan</code> or <code>colspan</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="background-color: lightskyblue;" colspan="3" rowspan="2">This cell has <code>rowspan="3"</code> and <code>colspan="2"</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                This makes it possible to create varying cell sizes with minimal effort, but it can be a pain to modify,
                which is the main reason to avoid using tables as a layout tool.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
        <section>
            <h3 id="import">@import</h3>
            <p>
                CSS allows for the inclusion of extra stylesheets using the <code>@import</code> directive. The syntax
                is as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code>@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700)</code></pre>
            <p>
                This is just one option of including multiple CSS files in a page. In general, it makes more sense to
                include each stylesheet separately in HTML using <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>. However, neither of these is
                best practice&mdash;the correct thing to do where possible is to <strong>only include one CSS file</strong>.
                This is due to the performance cost incurred by transferring multiple files over HTTP.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="floats">Floats</h3>
            <p>
                As we covered before, floating an element takes it out of the flow of the page, causing subsequent elements
                to wrap around it. This looks something like this:
            </p>
            <section class="example example--float">
                <img class="example-image" src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/200">
                <p class="example-text">
                    This text is going to wrap around the image, which will be floated to the left side using
                    <code>float: left</code>. Any subsequent content will also wrap around the floated element if it
                    can. This can be circumvented in various methods.
                </p>
            </section>
            <p>
                If you do not want an element to be wrapped around floated elements preceeding it, you can use a CSS
                property known as <code>clear</code>. As with float, <code>clear</code> can be set to <code>left</code>
                or <code>right</code>, or it can be set to <code>both</code> in order to clear all floats. But this
                introduces dependencies on the order of elements, and it can quickly become unmanageable. To circumvent
                this, various &ldquo;clearfixes&rdquo; have been developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A clearfix is a method of clearing floats from a group of elements to prevent them from impacting any
                subsequent elements. The most concise clearfix today looks this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>section:before, section:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
}

section:after {
    clear:both;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                This example will prevent any floats within a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> from impacting other parts of
                the page.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="twocolumn">Two-Column Layout</h3>
            <p>
                Right now, all of our text flows into a single column. How would we arrange our content into multiple
                columns? In the olden days of HTML, the answer would have been a table with <code>colspan</code>. Today,
                there is a better way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we talk about the ideal system for defining columns, let's take a look at an easy way to set up a
                multi-column layout in CSS. The first thing we need to do is to choose what top-level elements to define
                as our columns. In this case, we will keep it simple and use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> elements. We'll add an id to each of them in order to target only the
                top-level instances of these tags, since HTML5 allows elements such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to
                contain them as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turning this into a multi-column layout is simple: first we will float both elements to the left, and
                then we will specify their widths. This will allow them to flow next to each other, while still taking
                up the full space. Let's see that in code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>#main, #aside {
    float: left;
}

#aside {
    width: 33%;
}

#main {
    width: 67%;
}</code></pre>
            <p>And in practice:</p>
            <section class="example example--twocolumn">
                <aside class="example-aside">
                    <p>Example content for the aside.</p>
                </aside>
                <main class="example-main">
                    <p>Example content for the main section.</p>
                </main>
            </section>
            <p>
                Using percentages rather than pixels here allows the page to remain flexible as we scale our browsers to
                different widths. In a future lesson, we will discuss how we can change our layout for various screen
                sizes, but for now, we will assume these column sizes for all browsers. To prevent the layout from
                getting too wide, we can add a <code>max-width: 1100px</code> to the body that will let the page scale -
                up to a point.
            </p>
            <p>
                What would happen if we were to add a padding to one of our columns? In a previous lesson, we discussed
                the benefits of using <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>, and this is one of those cases. Without that
                setting, adding a padding to the element will cause our total width to surpass 100%, meaning that our
                columns will no longer fit next to each other. For example, if we were to define <code>#aside</code> as
            </p>
            <pre><code>#aside {
    width: 33%;
    padding-right: 2rem;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                the result would be a column that took up a width of 33% + 2rem, rather than 33%.
                This would look something like this:
            </p>
            <section class="example example--twocolumn">
                <aside class="example-aside example-aside--withPadding u-contentBoxed">
                    <p>Example content for the aside.</p>
                </aside>
                <main class="example-main u-contentBoxed">
                    <p>Example content for the main section.</p>
                </main>
            </section>
            <p>
                If we set <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>, however, we will see that the padding is cut into the 33%,
                rather than added to it:
            </p>
            <section class="example example--twocolumn">
                <aside class="example-aside example-aside--withPadding">
                    <p>Example content for the aside.</p>
                </aside>
                <main class="example-main">
                    <p>Example content for the main section.</p>
                </main>
            </section>
            <p>
                We can see how easy it is to define a quick two-column layout, but when designing a complicated website,
                this is often insufficient to design everything in an easy-to-maintain way. A common solution to this
                problem is to use a multi-column grid&mdash;most frequently a 12-, 16-, or 24-column grid. This is a great
                system, but in most cases, it comes at a cost&mdash;style information leaking into the HTML. The reason
                for this is that common implementations of a grid system involve using class names such as
                <code>.col-xs-4</code>, which effectively means that the number of columns has been defined in HTML,
                rather than CSS. This is a step up from inline styles, but it still creates a dependency that makes it
                difficult to change layouts down the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a better way to do this, and that way is to use a CSS preprocessor such as LESS or SASS. In a
                few weeks, we will begin to introduce some LESS into our stylesheets, allowing us to create much more
                flexible and reusable code. For now, we will stick to manually defining our percentages for our layout.
