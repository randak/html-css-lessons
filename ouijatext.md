CRITIC REVIEWS FOR OUIJA
All Critics (40) | Top Critics (13) | Fresh (5) | Rotten (35)

Best left on the shelf.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Kyle Anderson
Entertainment Weekly

A blah imitation of PG-13 haunted house movies like "Paranormal Activity" and "Insidious."
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Robert Abele
Los Angeles Times

It is harmless, frighty fun for teenage audiences, but adults will leave theatres with their bejeebers intact.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Brad Wheeler
Globe and Mail

Scares are more of the Saturday morning cartoon variety, clichéd or telegraphed well in advance.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Linda Barnard
Toronto Star

The closing credits announce that "Ouija" is "based on the Hasbro game," but unlike a movie ticket, a board game can easily be returned.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Ben Kenigsberg
New York Times

It's professionally produced but completely uninspired.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Katie Rife
AV Club

Born out of a desire to explain the seemingly inexplicable, the Ouija board remains enigmatic.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate

In the current economy, Monopoly makes a more appropriate board game upon which to base a horror movie, but for what it is, "Ouija" is better than expected.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Odie Henderson
RogerEbert.com

Unfortunately, this film wastes a frightening premise and is about as scary as an intense game of Candy Land.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Rebecca Murray
Showbiz Junkies

Featuring cheap jump scenes rather than actual spooky terror, possessing a fairly bland cast, and your standard array of dumb character actions, the flick offers few true frights. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Jim Judy
Screen It!

The film consistently settles for the cheapest shock devices and the most shopworn totems of our current neo-gothic moment in the genre.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Eric Henderson
Slant Magazine

You are likely to see some 5-year olds trick-or-treating on Halloween who are scarier than the ghosts and spirits on display in Ouija.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Willie Waffle
WaffleMovies.com

...this breaks no new ground, but it bumps along at a steady pace, providing the requisite scares and laughs along the way.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Daniel M. Kimmel
New England Movies Weekly

This kind of repetitive, transparent deceit is either lazy or cynical, or maybe it's a combination of both.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Mark Dujsik
Mark Reviews Movies

The sheer brazen chutzpah of turning a horror movie into an advertisement may be the most original concept here, all the more bizarre because of the horrors unfurled by the product in question.
Full Review… | October 24, 2014

Rob Vaux
Mania.com

Man am I sick of seeing people getting dragged out of shot by invisible forces.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Steve Newton
Georgia Straight

Wading into cheese, corn and sap by the grand finale, "Ouija" is a spineless chiller in desperate need of a sturdier, more confident brand of chills.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Dustin Putman
DustinPutman.com

By comparison, Ouija makes Hasbro's last attempt to adapt a board game look like pure genius.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Travis Hopson
Examiner.com

It's the audiences who pay to see this who are really getting played here.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

John Hanlon
John Hanlon Reviews

A threadbare attempt at a frightfest--dumb, turgid and ultimately tedious.
Full Review… | October 23, 2014

Frank Swietek
One Guy's Opinion

Ouija is a routine horror flick with a by-the-numbers story, bland characters & familiar "scares" that fail to scare.

AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR OUIJA
 ½
Elaine: I'm just not ready to let her go.  So Ouija is a total bust. Not that I expected much from a horror film based on the spooky toy, once mass-marketed by Parker Brothers, but it amounts to nothing all that special or entertaining, just laughably dull. Something interesting to note is how so many old slasher films and even the recent Saw franchise, among other horror franchises, end up receiving similar bad review scores, but will go on to be remembered by cult audiences. No one will remember Ouija. That is the kind of movie it is. This is a thing that will come and go. It may have allowed work for some young actors and a decent job for the filmmakers involved, but that's about it. Good on them for getting the film done, but yeah, it's just a silly horror movie.  read the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com
